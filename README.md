# Student-Registration-System
I developed a Student Registration System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 

What I Learned:
1. Local Storage: I implemented functionality to store, update, and delete student data using the browser's local storage. This allowed me to manage student records seamlessly.

2. Pagination: I added pagination to improve user experience by displaying student records in a manageable format.

3. Dynamic DOM Manipulation: I learned how to dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements based on user input, which enhances the interactivity of the application.

4. Event Handling: I explored the differences between window.onload and DOMContentLoaded events, which helped me understand when to execute code based on the document's readiness.
